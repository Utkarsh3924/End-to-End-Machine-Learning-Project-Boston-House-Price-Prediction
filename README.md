# End-to-End-Machine-Learning-Project-Boston-House-Price-Prediction

Implemented an end-to-end ML pipeline to predict house prices in the Boston area<br>
 * Utilized the publicly available Boston Housing Dataset and Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution, 
   identify and handle missing values, and address outliers.
 * Engineered new features based on domain knowledge and statistical analysis to potentially enhance model performance.
 * Implemented and evaluated various regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree).
 * Analysed model performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
